# Monotonic Number Grid

CLI app that plots an N x N number grid, with monotonic increasing numbers beginning from; 1 where 1 is the origin residing at the centre point of the grid.

Upon launch you will be prompted whether you wish to play the game (option 1) or whether to quit the application (options 2). If you choose option 1 you can then specify a grid size and a sub menu will allow you to view coordinate details for any position within the generated grid. Press `q` to return to the main menu.  

## Usage

## Tests
